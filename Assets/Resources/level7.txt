Wow, not even aliens can make you people understand it is not me who controls the weather. I am done with reporting the weather for you guys. I'm moving to a different planet tomorrow. As my last weather report, i hope you all get hit by the meteorites today. Bye Earth, I won't miss you. You're doomed anyway. Global Warming was going to finish us off anyway.
